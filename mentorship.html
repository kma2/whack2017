				<h3> About </h3>
				<p class="description"> This semester, WHACK will take place at Wellesley College on the weekend of February 11-12, 2017. Approximately 100 undergraduates will come together for 24 hours to develop innovative web, mobile and hardware projects. Our goal is to create a supportive environment that empowers women in technology through intimate mentor-based experiences. At WHACK, students are encouraged to explore new technologies and their creative potential. </p>
				<h3> We're looking for mentors with... </h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square">
					<li> A background in web development, software engineering, UX/UI Design, and/or computer science </li>
					<li> An energetic approach for facilitating teamwork, problem solving, and workflow. </li>
					<li> A love for hackathons! </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h3> Why mentor? </h3>
				<p class="description"> Mentoring is an amazing opportunity to network with current undergraduates working towards computer science and technical degrees. Mentors have the ability to inspire, teach, and lead students to success in a way that will create lasting professional bonds at WHACK. </p>
